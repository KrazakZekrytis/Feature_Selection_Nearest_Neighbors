# Feature Selection - Nearest Neighbors

This project uses nearest neighbor to choose features of a dataset that can be used in future machine learning models. There are two methods to choosing features: forward selection and backward elimination. And there are two different dataset: a small dataset with 10 features, and a large dataset with 50 features.
